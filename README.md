# AR-Artwork

This project was heavily jump started using Logan Engstrom's fast-style-transfer repository.

ARArtworkApp is the application side of the project.
fast-style-transfer is the style transfer algorithm side of the project.

Within each of these directories, you'll find their own READMEs.

Google Colab (for running and testing the algorithm) - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ATiIfH8aMpWvgFvr-XGT6tt9NUbK5mrk
